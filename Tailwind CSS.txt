How to keep rgb value : className = "bg-[rgb(37,150,190)]" 
When applied to a flex item, margin: auto has special and powerful behavior — it can be used to push the item to one side, center it, or even control spacing dynamically.

In flex-direction: row (default), the main axis is horizontal → margin-left: auto or margin: auto affects horizontal alignment.
margin-left: auto	This pushes the item to the right (because it takes all the space on the left)
margin-right: auto	Pushes item to the left
margin: auto	Centers item both vertically & horizontally (if space allows)

In flex-direction: column, the main axis is vertical → margin-top: auto or margin: auto affects vertical alignment.
margin-top: auto	Pushes item to bottom of container
margin-bottom: auto	Pushes item to top of container

React by itself doesn’t know how to handle URLs or page navigation. So, we use react-router-dom to:
Navigate between pages
Show or hide components based on the current URL
Create single-page applications (SPAs) with multiple views
